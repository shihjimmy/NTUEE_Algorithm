#### Problem: 
finish IS,HS,QS,MS  

## PA2  
### Maximum Planar Subset  
#### Problem: 
Given is a set C of n chords of a circle. Assume that no two chords of C share an endpoint.  
Number the endpoints of these chords from 0 to 2n − 1, clockwise around the circle.  
Let M(i, j), i ≤ j, denote the number of chords in the maximum planar subset (i.e., no two chords overlap each other in the subset)   
in the region formed by the chord ij and the arc between the endpoints i and j.  

## PA3  
### Cycle Breaking
#### Problem:  
Given a simple graph G = (V, E) which may contain cycles, we want to remove some edges to make the graph acyclic with minimum total cost (weight).
