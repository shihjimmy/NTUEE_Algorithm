HOW I GET THE ANSWERS

	1.Do Kruskal algorithm but edges are sorted from biggest to smallest
	2.Record the edges to be deleted
	3.If graph is undirected, finished
	4.If graph is directed, add the deleted edge back to the graph(one by one),and check whether there are cycles
	  -if there is a cycle,then that edge must be deleted
	  -if not, it can be put back to the directed graph.
